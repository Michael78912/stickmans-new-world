this file is me trying to debug my algorithms

playcoords = [3, 10, 19]
mycoord = 14

dest = abs(minimum(14 - 3, 14 - 10, 14 - 19)) ?-> abs(min(11, 4, -5) -> -5) -> 5
// not working

foreach playcoords -> 

x = 3
abs(14 - 3) = 11

x=10
abs(14 - 10) = 4

x = 19
abs(14 - 19) = 5

possible = [11, 4, 5]
coord = min(possible) = 4

for i, b in zip(playcoords, possible):
	if
