2018-03-13  0:05:47.73 i havent been able to work on this very much recently, i hope i can change that soon with spring break coming up :)

2018-03-31 22:06:00.24 worked a lot on character_image.py, started and started and finished request_email.py, and updated the auto updater (ironic :)) also upgraded the python version 3.4- it is exciting because i can use the f'{locals}' type string!
