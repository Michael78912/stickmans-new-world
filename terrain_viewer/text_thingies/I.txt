Thanks for installing the smr terrain viewer! to get started, look at the file C:\Program Files (x86)\smr terrain viewer\terrains\flat.smr-terrain in notepad (by clicking edit in the context menu) NOTE: colons (: symbols) are not used yet, so if you use them, it might result in an error. also, if you do see an error, please report it to me and send a picture of the error at michaelveenstra12@gmail.com and i will try to fix iit as soon as i can. thank you!
